Over the last 2 weeks I've been auditing the pilot Hack Reactor "CodeRamp" course.  It's a 4 week part time course.  No prior programming experience is expected.  The course is taught Monday-Thursday 6:30-9, and on Saturday from 1-4.  Its the first time the Hack Reactor team has offered the course, and the material is being developed as we go along.  The class is a mixture of demo lecture augmented with a heaping helping set of challange exercises.

So far the course has covered how to use the commandline for basic navigation, basic HTML and CSS, a taste of JavaScript, and dose of JQuery.  Students are starting to make portfolio websites, and number of them are pretty amazing.  Check out Alex Stein's site: http://alexistein.divshot.io/.  And how about Reid Schofflen's: http://staging.maker-square-app.divshot.io/#

It's pretty clear that some of the people in the class have prior experience...I fall into that bucket too.
