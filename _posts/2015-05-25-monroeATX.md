Here are a few notes about how I created this website.

Executive Summary:

1. Grab a Template: I choose [Simple Sidebar](/startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/).
2. Bring in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
3. Throw in a Bootstrap [Carousel](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp).
4. Add an [powr.io](http://www.powr.io/) Contact form.
5. Add in a cool div with an image, a cool [hover animation]() and [overlay](http://www.corelangs.com/css/box/hover.html).
6. Done.

This was actually not as simple as it sounds.  I found a [thorough and amazing Jekyll tutorial](http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/) by Andrrew Munsell.
