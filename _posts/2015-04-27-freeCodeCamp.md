Over the last 3 months I've spent time learning web development, but more importantly, studying how numerous coding schools and camps organize, aggregate, and present material.  One in particular attempts to weave lesson blocks from disparate system into a comprehenisive and cohesive set takes a learner down the web development stack from html server side javascript and then out into the software development world: freecodecamp.org.  It's unique not only because it strings together lessons from numerous sources, but it starts by connecting the learner with a community and encourages people to work with others on projects.  Over the course of this next week I'm going to do some writing about a few of the most interesting aspects of the site and program.

Lets start with "Curriculum".  Here's the outline:
