Over the last 3 months I’ve been digging into online coding schools and curriculum’s. I’ve concentrated on teaching & learning web development, and studied how numerous coding schools and camps organize, aggregate, present and track learning and assessment material. Freecodecamp.org has a number of features that make it interesting and inviting. It’s all about the web and the web stack. In addition to lessons on programming languages they have lessons about tools and frameworks as well as modern development process’s such as pair programming and Agile. 

FCC integrates lesson blocks from disparate system into a comprehensive and mostly cohesive set of “lessons”, which they term waypoints. Each waypoint take a learner/campers down a piece of the web development stack. It starts at the top with html, css and server side javascript down into the server development world. It’s unique not only because it strings together lessons from numerous sources, but it starts by connecting the learner with a community and encourages people to work with others on projects. Over the course of this few weeks I’m be doing some writing about a few of the most interesting aspects of the site and program.

Lets start with “Curriculum”. Here’s the outline of what you’ll learn:

It includes pieces that many beginning programming site and teaching: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, but it’s the other parts that make it interesting and unique.

# Tools

Debugging and optimizing performance are a huge part of programming, so it’s important to get a feel for the tools and techniques early. For web development, the browser is where pages are build and rendered, so learning these tools is a must. FCC sends you off to learn about how to use the [Crome DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/), googles excellent tutorial site. 

Git is also a must know tool as well. Version control is such an integral part of team software development, its always surprising that it’s not taught early on.

Beyond that, there is sections of the course about algorithms (coding practice), testing, and sections on process and key server side platform components.
